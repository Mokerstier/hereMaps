# MapBox ft. ESP32
Service to add markers to a map and adding data to the marker

In this repo will be explained how to set up a ESP32 and send data from the device to an browser.
The data that was sent will be displayed on a map generated by [mapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

## Requirements
To be able to use this repo knowledge of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and javascript is required.

- ESP32
- Grove Ligth Sensor
- Node server
- [Adafruit](https://io.adafruit.com/) account

### Step 1 (hardware)
First set up your ESP32
- Connect the wires
  - GROUND connects with GND (usually the black wire)
  - VCC connects with VIN(5v) (usually the red wire)
  - SIG connects with D27 (usually the yellow wire)

### CHECKPOINT 1
If you connected the wires you can test if your Light Sensor is working with the following code:
```javascript
#define LIGHT_SENSOR 27

void setup() {
Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop(){
int sensorValue = analogRead(LIGHT_SENSOR);
Serial.println("Data from LIGHT_SENSOR is:");
Serial.println(sensorValue);
}
```
If everything is working corectly your Serialmonitor would log somethign like this:

`Data from LIGHT_SENSOR is:`

`4095` <- (Max value = loads of light)

Well done you completed step 1

### Step 3
Connect your ESP32 to the internet and establish a connection with adafruit
